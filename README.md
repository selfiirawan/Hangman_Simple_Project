# 🕹️ Hangman Game (Python)

A simple Hangman game built using Python — a classic word-guessing game where you try to guess the hidden word one letter at a time before you run out of chances.

## 📚 About

This project was created as part of my learning journey through a **Python course on Udemy**. It's a beginner-friendly implementation that helped me practice fundamental programming concepts such as:

- Strings and lists
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions
- User input
- Basic game logic

## 🧠 How It Works

- The program selects a random word from a predefined list.
- The user is prompted to guess letters one by one.
- For each incorrect guess, a life is lost.
- The game ends when the user either guesses the word or runs out of lives.

## ▶️ Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your machine

### Run the Game
Clone the repository and run the script:
```bash
python hangman.py
